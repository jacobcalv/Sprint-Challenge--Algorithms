#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is 0(n), Linear Time. Only has a while loop and runs until values are equal within the equation. 


b) This is O(n^2) because there is a while loop within a for loop making them both run n times. 


c) This is 0(n), Linear Time because it will stop when the number of bunnies are gone.

## Exercise II

To solve this problem I would use a Binary search with a complexity of 0(log n).

As binary searches work in code, we would start at the middle (floor) and if this was too high we would set the floor number to the right and continue downward. 
--If the egg did not break we would continue to a higher floor and set the floor number to the left and continue upward until we find the floor that is the highest possible floor for the egg.
